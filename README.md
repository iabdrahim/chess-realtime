npm install
Note: If you choose npm, it will generate a package-lock.json file. You can safely delete the yarn.lock file if you decide to use npm as your package manager.

2. Create environment variables:

Begin by duplicating the .env.example file and renaming the duplicate as .env.
Inside the newly created .env file, modify the values of the environment variables according to your specific requirements.
Note: Remember not to include the .env file in version control, as it is already specified in the .gitignore file. However, the .env.example file is committed to version control to serve as a reference for the necessary environment variables

3. Run the development server:

If you are using Yarn:

yarn dev
If you are using npm:

npm run dev

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.
